Files related to the paper "Assessing the economic effects of lockdowns in Italy: a computational Input-Output approach"

The repository contains spreadhseets detailing the lockdown shocks applied in the model. 
In addition, it provides the model script and most auxiliary files necessary to reproduce the simulations presented in the paper.
In order to run the model, the inter-regional IO table for Italy as well as the bridge matrix relating changes in output to changes in consumption demand are also needed.
